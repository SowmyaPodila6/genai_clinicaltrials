ABSTRACT

This is a Phase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Drug X 
in patients with advanced cancer. The primary endpoint is overall survival.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Novel treatments are needed 
to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

METHODS

This study will recruit 200 patients from multiple centers. Patients will be 
randomized to receive either Drug X or placebo.

Study Design

This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

RESULTS

The primary analysis will be conducted when 150 events have occurred.

DISCUSSION

The results of this study will inform future treatment guidelines.

CONCLUSIONS

Drug X shows promise as a new treatment option for advanced cancer patients.
