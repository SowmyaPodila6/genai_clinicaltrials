This is particularly important\n          when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a\n          liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.\n                                                                                    \n          A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was notscanned at baseline\n          is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the subject\n          who has visceral disease at baseline and while on studyhas a CT or MRI brainscanordered which\n          reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if\n                                                                                    \n          he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.                            \n          If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-\n          up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is\n          definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.\n                                                                                    \n          4       RESPONSE  CRITERIA                                                \n                                                                                    \n          4.1     Time point response                                               \n          Aresponse assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol.\n                                                                                    \n          For subjects who have measurable disease at baseline Table 1 provides a summary of the overall\n          response status calculation at each time point.                           \n                                                                                    \n                  Table 1.
